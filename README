Hi Cole! 
The app runs well on my computer so there is no need for debugging; however, the link to Personal Information is just text and 
I had to click around awhile to figure out it was a button. I don't know if it looks like a button on IOS application but it doesn't
on mine. I don't see any problems in your code though. Your button is formatted to have a different background color but it doesn't 
on an android emulator. 
Scheme wise I would suggest you source some color theme from the picture you used instead of the brown. I do like the lighter text. 
Also, the background color of your second window I think should be something other than black that goes with/compliments the 
theme of window 1. 
Good job!
